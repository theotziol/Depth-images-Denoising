# Depth-images-Denoising
Denoising depth images from real sense by mapping to conor10 laser
This is the implementation of SRCNN https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03264v1.pdf for my dissertation thesis,
on denoising depth images with supervised learning. 
The dataset consists of 95 depthmaps of Real Sense (input) and 95 depthmaps of conor10 laser (label)
